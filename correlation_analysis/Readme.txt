Below are the instructions to use the matlab codes in this folder for performing the correlation analysis used and discussed in Thiagarajan et al., paper.

The code files are split into several parts. Therefore all these files should be placed together in the same folder. Then:

1. Open the RunFile.m
2. Change the location to the PIV files in line 9.
3. Change the PIV step size in micrometers in lines 14 and 15
4. Change the time between frames in line 16
5. Change the number of frames to be analysed i.e the number of PIV files to be analysed in line 21.
6. Run the script.

This will generate the correlation plots and text files with correlation values and save them in the same folder where the codes are present.
